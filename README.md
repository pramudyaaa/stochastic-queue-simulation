# stochastic-queue-simulation
This repository contains implementations and analyses of stochastic queueing systems, specifically the **M/M/1** and **M/M/3** models.  
The project demonstrates simulation techniques, exponential distribution behavior, and performance metrics estimation in queueing theory.
