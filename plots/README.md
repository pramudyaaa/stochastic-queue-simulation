# Plots

This folder contains visualization outputs generated from the queueing system simulations.

You may place plots here such as:
- Inter-arrival time histogram (M/M/1)
- QQ-plot comparing simulated data with the theoretical exponential distribution
- Service time distribution visualization
- System state over time (optional)

These plots help to validate and visually analyze the behavior of the simulated queueing models.
